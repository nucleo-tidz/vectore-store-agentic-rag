Rule 1: Base Cost Calculation  
The base cost for a container is calculated as:  
BaseCost = ContainerVolume × BaseRatePerCBM

Rule 2: High-Density Surcharge
If the GrossWeight (in kg) divided by ContainerVolume Volume  exceeds 250, add a 10% surcharge on the base cost.

Rule 3: Hazardous Material Fee
If the cargo is marked as hazardous, add a flat fee of ₹1500 to the total cost.

Rule 4: Route Fuel Multiplier
For routes labeled as "FuelSensitive", multiply flat fee of 1.15 to the total cost.

Rule 5: Special Handling Fee
If SpecialHandling is required, add ₹500 per container.

Rule 6: Discount for Green Certified Routes
If the route is marked as "GreenCertified", apply a 5% discount to the final cost.

Example of Calculation

Inputs
- ContainerVolume = 50.3 CBM
- GrossWeight = 6500 kg
- Hazardous = no
- Route = FuelSensitive
- SpecialHandling = no
- BaseRatePerCBM = ₹1001

Calculation

Should result in a final calculated cost using all applicable rules.
Step 1: Base Cost
BaseCost = 50.3 × ₹1001 = ₹50,350.30

Step 2: Density Check
Density = 6500 ÷ 50.3 = 129.2 (which is < 250)
No high-density surcharge

Step 3: Hazardous Check
Hazardous = No →  No fee

Step 4: Special Handling Check
SpecialHandling = No → No fee

Step 5: FuelSensitive Route Multiplier
CostAfterFuel = ₹50,350.30 × 1.15 = ₹57,902.84

Step 6: GreenCertified Discount
Not applicable → No discount
